[Intro]
Welcome to our family time
Welcome to our family time

[Verse 1]
There's nothing complicated
About the way we live
We're all here for each other's equity
Happy to give
All we have we share
And all of us we care
So come on

[Chorus]
Welcome to our standup time
Welcome to our brotherly time
This is our festival
You know that best of all
We're here to share it all

[Verse 2]
There's a bond between us
Nobody can explain
It's a celebration of life
We see friends again
I'll be there for you
I know you'll be there for me too
So come on

[Chorus]
Welcome to our family time
Welcome to our brotherly time
This is our festival
You know that best of all
We're here to share it all

[Bridge]
Remembering loved ones departed
Someone dear to your heart
Finding love, planing a future
Telling stories and laughing with friends
Precious moments you'll never forget

This has to be the most beautiful
The most peaceful place I've ever been to
It's nothing like I've seen before

[Chorus]
Welcome to our family time
Welcome to our brotherly time
We're happy giving and taking
To the friends we're making
There's nothing we won't do

Welcome to our family time
Welcome to our happy to be time
This is our festival
You know that best of all
We're here to share it
[Outro]
Best of all
We're here to share it all

Welcome to our family time
Welcome to our family
Welcome to our brotherly time
We're here to share it all
Welcome to our family time
Welcome to our family
