# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

> **Note**: This guide is for developers working ON the Canvas MCP codebase. If you're an AI agent USING the MCP server, see [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) instead.

# Canvas MCP Development Guide

## Environment Setup
- Install uv package manager: `pip install uv`
- Install dependencies: `uv pip install -e .`
- Create `.env` file with `CANVAS_API_TOKEN` and `CANVAS_API_URL`
- Server installed as CLI command: `canvas-mcp-server`

## Commands
- **Start server**: `canvas-mcp-server` (or `./start_canvas_server.sh` for legacy setup)
- **Test server**: `canvas-mcp-server --test`
- **View config**: `canvas-mcp-server --config`
- **MCP client config**: Update your MCP client's configuration file (e.g., `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` for Claude Desktop)

## Architecture Overview

FastMCP server; type-driven validation via `@validate_params`; dual-layer course code↔ID caching; flexible identifiers (`get_course_id()`); ISO-8601 dates. Tools use a List→Details→Content→Analytics progressive-disclosure pattern, grouped by Canvas entity, named `{action}_{entity}`. All Canvas calls route through `make_canvas_request()` with async I/O, automatic pagination, and configurable anonymization.

**Full design reference** (patterns, parameter validation, analytics engine, messaging system): [internal/architecture.md](internal/architecture.md).

## Git Workflow - ASK FIRST

**Before starting any new feature or significant change, ASK:**
> "Should I create a feature branch for this, or work directly on main?"

| Change Type | Default Branch | Notes |
|-------------|----------------|-------|
| New tool/feature | `feature/tool-name` | PR with CI checks |
| Bug fix | `fix/issue-description` | PR recommended |
| Documentation only | `main` okay | Direct push acceptable |
| Quick fix (typo, etc.) | `main` okay | Direct push acceptable |

**Branch naming:** `feature/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`

This repo has branch protection on `main` (PR + status checks required), but admin can bypass. Always ask the user which workflow they prefer for the current task.

## Release Checklist

When bumping the version in `pyproject.toml`, also update:
- [ ] `src/canvas_mcp/__init__.py` - Update `__version__`
- [ ] `server.json` - Update both `version` fields (top-level and packages[0]) for MCP Registry
- [ ] `tools/TOOL_MANIFEST.json` - Update `version` field to match new version
- [ ] `README.md` - Update "Latest Release" section with new version, date, and changelog
- [ ] `docs/index.html` - Update version badge, tool count, and meta descriptions (GitHub Pages site)
- [ ] Create git tag: `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`

> `manifest.json` (Desktop Extension) does **not** need a manual bump — `create-release.yml` stamps the tag version into it and attaches `canvas-mcp.mcpb` to the GitHub Release automatically. The committed `manifest.json` version is just a default.

---

## Coding Standards
- **Type hints**: Mandatory for all functions, use Union/Optional appropriately
- **MCP tools**: Use `@mcp.tool()` decorator with `@validate_params`
- **Async functions**: All API interactions must be async
- **Course identifiers**: Use `Union[str, int]` and `get_course_id()` for flexibility
- **Date handling**: Use `format_date()` for all date outputs
- **Error responses**: Return JSON strings with "error" key for failures
- **Form data**: Use `use_form_data=True` for Canvas POST/PUT endpoints
- **Privacy**: Student IDs preserved, names anonymized in `_should_anonymize_endpoint()`
- **Optional params**: Use `Optional[T]` type hints for parameters that can be `None`

## Test-Driven Development (TDD) - ENFORCED

**All new MCP tools MUST have tests before the feature is considered complete.**

### TDD Workflow
1. **Write tests first** (or alongside) for new tools
2. **Minimum 3 tests per tool**: success path, error handling, edge case
3. **Run tests** before committing: `uv run python -m pytest tests/ -v`
4. **No merging** without passing tests

### Test Structure
```
tests/
├── tools/           # Unit tests for MCP tools
│   ├── test_modules.py    # Reference implementation
│   ├── test_pages.py      # Page tools tests
│   └── ...
└── security/        # Security-focused tests
```

### Test Patterns (from test_modules.py)
```python
@pytest.fixture
def mock_canvas_request():
    with patch('canvas_mcp.tools.modules.make_canvas_request') as mock:
        yield mock

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_tool_success(mock_canvas_request, mock_course_id):
    mock_canvas_request.return_value = {"id": 123, "name": "Test"}
    result = await tool_function(course_identifier="test", ...)
    assert "success" in result.lower() or "123" in result
```

### What to Test
- ✅ Successful API responses
- ✅ API error handling (404, 401, 500)
- ✅ Parameter validation (missing required params, invalid types)
- ✅ Edge cases (empty lists, None values, special characters)
- ✅ Canvas API quirks (form data requirements, pagination)

See: [Issue #56](https://github.com/vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp/issues/56) for comprehensive test coverage plan.

## Canvas API Specifics
- Base URL from `CANVAS_API_URL` environment variable
- Authentication via Bearer token in `CANVAS_API_TOKEN`
- Always use pagination for list endpoints
- Course codes preferred over IDs in user-facing output
- Handle both published and unpublished content states
- **Messaging requires form data**: Use `use_form_data=True` for `/conversations` endpoints
- **Privacy protection**: Real user IDs preserved for functionality, names anonymized for privacy

## Documentation Maintenance

**Source of truth per audience:**
- **AI agents**: `AGENTS.md` (tool tables, workflows, constraints)
- **Humans**: `tools/README.md` (full tool docs with all params)
- **Machine**: `tools/TOOL_MANIFEST.json`
- **Entry point**: `README.md` (installation, overview — update on major releases only)

**When adding a new tool**, update: `tools/README.md` → `AGENTS.md` → `TOOL_MANIFEST.json`. Do NOT update `README.md` unless it's a major feature. Do NOT duplicate tool usage docs in `CLAUDE.md` (architecture only).

## Current Focus
- [x] Release v1.3.0 — `create_rubric` (#100), `read_course_file` (#90), event-loop fix (#99), bulk-delete safety (#96); tool count 88 → 90; CHANGELOG.md added
- [x] Follow-up: split publish-mcp.yml into separate PyPI + MCP Registry jobs with PyPI-propagation poll (PR #107)
- [x] Follow-up: add `ruff`/`black`/`mypy` to dev deps in pyproject.toml; remove unused `requests`; `setup-python@v4 → @v6` (PR #105)
- [x] Retired public hosted server (`mcp.illinihunt.org`) — security teardown + cleaned all references (memory, website, README/AGENTS/CHANGELOG)
- [x] Issue #115: Gies/Azure hosted deployment — **DONE 2026-06-17.** v2 Entra platform-auth (#125) + a private custom domain (bound + managed cert; URL in gitignored `docs/ops-hosted.local.md`) **resolves the `AADSTS9010010` mcp-remote blocker — verified live, all clients work.** App renamed `gies-canvas-mcp` → `canvas-mcp` (house-consistent; old apps deleted). Branch→slot CI added (#128/#129). Remaining polish: tighten `MCP_ENTRA_ALLOWED_OIDS`; AcrPull RBAC fix (needs Adam, still on ACR admin-user creds)
- [x] PR #126: `check_enrollment` capability — **merged + shipped in v1.4.0.** Deferred: REST endpoint + teacher-token-sourcing decision
- [x] Claude Desktop Extension (`.mcpb`) — scaffolded, distributed via GitHub Releases (auto-attached on tag), README install section; shipped in v1.4.0
- [x] Release **v1.4.0** — GitHub + PyPI + MCP Registry + hosted server + website all live
- [x] PR #150: self-service access-approval flow for the hosted server — merged 2026-07-01
- [ ] PR #155: `update_discussion_topic` (#154) — draft open; merge → auto-deploy to hosted
- [ ] Issue #145 / PR #152: fastmcp 2.x migration — **PR 1 of 2 merged 2026-07-02** (code migration, 560 tests green); PR 2 (Azure staging/Entra validation) still open
- [ ] Backlog triage (module templates, bulk creation, page versioning)
- [ ] Issue #106: 186 mypy errors uncovered by adding mypy to dev deps — incremental cleanup, module by module

## Roadmap
- [x] Release v1.0.8 — all CI/CD pipelines passing (PyPI, MCP Registry, GitHub Release)
- [x] Learning Designer tools & skills — `get_course_structure` tool + 3 skills (QC, accessibility, builder)
- [x] GitHub Pages audit — 7 disconnects fixed (tool count, test count, analytics, URLs, compatibility)
- [x] MCP token optimization — trimmed tool docstrings ~35% (350 lines removed across 15 files)
- [x] HTTP transport & hosted server — per-request credentials via ContextVar. VPS instance (mcp.illinihunt.org) **decommissioned 2026-06-05** (workshop-only; public code-exec surface); Gies/Azure rebuild tracked in issue #115
- [x] Cloudflare Pages migration — site moved from GitHub Pages (blocked by Actions) to Cloudflare Pages
- [x] Release v1.2.0 — role-based filtering, accessibility remediation, security hardening, contributor acknowledgements
- [x] Release v1.3.0 — create_rubric, read_course_file, event-loop fix, bulk-delete safety, CHANGELOG.md

## Backlog
- [x] Impact tracker: automated weekly stats collection + website section
- [ ] Module templates (pre-configured module structures)
- [ ] Bulk module creation from JSON/YAML specs
- [ ] Module duplication across courses
- [ ] Page templates
- [ ] Bulk page creation from markdown files
- [ ] Page content versioning/history tools

## Hosted Deployment (Azure — #115)

There is a **private, Entra-gated** hosted instance for Gies course staff. It is **not shared
publicly** — keep its endpoint URL, Entra app IDs, deploy specifics, and access-key holders out
of this (public) repo. All operational detail lives in the **gitignored** `internal/ops-hosted.local.md`
(moved out of `docs/` on 2026-06-21 — that dir is the Cloudflare Pages publish root and was serving
these local-only files publicly; `docs/.assetsignore` is now a backstop).

- **Architecture (no secrets):** Azure App Service (Web App for Containers) inside the UIUC
  `urbana-business-disruptionlab` subscription, fronted by App Service Easy Auth in API/bearer
  mode (Entra platform auth, RFC 9728 PRM + `401` challenge). The app reads the trusted
  `X-MS-CLIENT-PRINCIPAL-ID`; each caller passes their own `X-Canvas-Token`; the Canvas URL is
  server-pinned; `CANVAS_API_TOKEN` must never be set in HTTP mode (startup guard). Deploy is
  branch→slot GitHub Actions (`deploy-prod.yml` / `deploy-staging.yml`).
- The open-source **self-hosted (stdio)** path is the public product — see `README.md` / `AGENTS.md`.
  HTTP-transport env-var *names* live in `env.template` / `core/config.py`; the hosted *instance*
  is operator-only.

## Session Log
> Full history: [internal/session-history.md](./internal/session-history.md)

### 2026-07-04 — `update_discussion_topic` implemented; draft PR #155 open
- Reviewed #154 (discussion edit gap hit during SBC 511 launch prep), confirmed valid — pages/assignments
  updatable via MCP but graded discussion prompts are not.
- Implemented educator-only `update_discussion_topic` on `feature/update-discussion-topic`: partial-update
  PUT to `/discussion_topics/:id` (title, message, published, pinned, locked, scheduling); covers
  announcements too. 6 new tests (11 total in test_discussions.py); docs synced (AGENTS.md, tools/README,
  TOOL_MANIFEST). Confirmed local + hosted share one codebase — single registration, transport-only diff.
- Committed (`fc8df89`), pushed, opened **draft PR #155**.
- Next: (1) Review/merge PR #155; close #154 on merge. (2) Manual verify on SBC 511 (70438) — apply the
  Week 1 discussion wording fix via MCP. (3) Run SBC 511 launch audit (still queued from 7/3). (4) PR #153
  (dockerfile hosted extra), fastmcp 2.x PR 2, #142 MCP SDK v2 deadline ~7/27, #106 mypy cleanup.
