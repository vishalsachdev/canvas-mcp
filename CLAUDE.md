# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

> **Note**: This guide is for developers working ON the Canvas MCP codebase. If you're an AI agent USING the MCP server, see [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) instead.

# Canvas MCP Development Guide

## Environment Setup
- Install uv package manager: `pip install uv`
- Install dependencies: `uv pip install -e .`
- Create `.env` file with `CANVAS_API_TOKEN` and `CANVAS_API_URL`
- Server installed as CLI command: `canvas-mcp-server`

## Commands
- **Start server**: `canvas-mcp-server` (or `./start_canvas_server.sh` for legacy setup)
- **Test server**: `canvas-mcp-server --test`
- **View config**: `canvas-mcp-server --config`
- **MCP client config**: Update your MCP client's configuration file (e.g., `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` for Claude Desktop)

## Architecture Overview

FastMCP server; type-driven validation via `@validate_params`; dual-layer course code↔ID caching; flexible identifiers (`get_course_id()`); ISO-8601 dates. Tools use a List→Details→Content→Analytics progressive-disclosure pattern, grouped by Canvas entity, named `{action}_{entity}`. All Canvas calls route through `make_canvas_request()` with async I/O, automatic pagination, and configurable anonymization.

**Full design reference** (patterns, parameter validation, analytics engine, messaging system): [internal/architecture.md](internal/architecture.md).

## Git Workflow - ASK FIRST

**Before starting any new feature or significant change, ASK:**
> "Should I create a feature branch for this, or work directly on main?"

| Change Type | Default Branch | Notes |
|-------------|----------------|-------|
| New tool/feature | `feature/tool-name` | PR with CI checks |
| Bug fix | `fix/issue-description` | PR recommended |
| Documentation only | `main` okay | Direct push acceptable |
| Quick fix (typo, etc.) | `main` okay | Direct push acceptable |

**Branch naming:** `feature/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`

This repo has branch protection on `main` (PR + status checks required), but admin can bypass. Always ask the user which workflow they prefer for the current task.

## Release Checklist

Version-bump procedure (files to update) + publish-race gotchas: **[internal/release-checklist.md](internal/release-checklist.md)**.

---

## Coding Standards
- **Type hints**: Mandatory for all functions, use Union/Optional appropriately
- **MCP tools**: Use `@mcp.tool()` decorator with `@validate_params`
- **Async functions**: All API interactions must be async
- **Course identifiers**: Use `Union[str, int]` and `get_course_id()` for flexibility
- **Date handling**: Use `format_date()` for all date outputs
- **Error responses**: Return JSON strings with "error" key for failures
- **Form data**: Use `use_form_data=True` for Canvas POST/PUT endpoints
- **Privacy**: Student IDs preserved, names anonymized in `_should_anonymize_endpoint()`
- **Optional params**: Use `Optional[T]` type hints for parameters that can be `None`

## Test-Driven Development (TDD) - ENFORCED

**All new MCP tools MUST have tests before the feature is considered complete.**

### TDD Workflow
1. **Write tests first** (or alongside) for new tools
2. **Minimum 3 tests per tool**: success path, error handling, edge case
3. **Run tests** before committing: `uv run python -m pytest tests/ -v`
4. **No merging** without passing tests

### Test Structure
```
tests/
├── tools/           # Unit tests for MCP tools
│   ├── test_modules.py    # Reference implementation
│   ├── test_pages.py      # Page tools tests
│   └── ...
└── security/        # Security-focused tests
```

### Test Patterns (from test_modules.py)
```python
@pytest.fixture
def mock_canvas_request():
    with patch('canvas_mcp.tools.modules.make_canvas_request') as mock:
        yield mock

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_tool_success(mock_canvas_request, mock_course_id):
    mock_canvas_request.return_value = {"id": 123, "name": "Test"}
    result = await tool_function(course_identifier="test", ...)
    assert "success" in result.lower() or "123" in result
```

### What to Test
- ✅ Successful API responses
- ✅ API error handling (404, 401, 500)
- ✅ Parameter validation (missing required params, invalid types)
- ✅ Edge cases (empty lists, None values, special characters)
- ✅ Canvas API quirks (form data requirements, pagination)

See: [Issue #56](https://github.com/vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp/issues/56) for comprehensive test coverage plan.

## Canvas API Specifics
- Base URL from `CANVAS_API_URL` environment variable
- Authentication via Bearer token in `CANVAS_API_TOKEN`
- Always use pagination for list endpoints
- Course codes preferred over IDs in user-facing output
- Handle both published and unpublished content states
- **Messaging requires form data**: Use `use_form_data=True` for `/conversations` endpoints
- **Privacy protection**: Real user IDs preserved for functionality, names anonymized for privacy

## Documentation Maintenance

**Source of truth per audience:**
- **AI agents**: `AGENTS.md` (tool tables, workflows, constraints)
- **Humans**: `tools/README.md` (full tool docs with all params)
- **Machine**: `tools/TOOL_MANIFEST.json`
- **Entry point**: `README.md` (installation, overview — update on major releases only)

**When adding a new tool**, update: `tools/README.md` → `AGENTS.md` → `TOOL_MANIFEST.json`. Do NOT update `README.md` unless it's a major feature. Do NOT duplicate tool usage docs in `CLAUDE.md` (architecture only).

## Current Focus

## Hosted Deployment (Azure — #115)

There is a **private, Entra-gated** hosted instance for Gies course staff. It is **not shared
publicly** — keep its endpoint URL, Entra app IDs, deploy specifics, and access-key holders out
of this (public) repo. All operational detail lives in the **gitignored** `internal/ops-hosted.local.md`
(moved out of `docs/` on 2026-06-21 — that dir is the Cloudflare Pages publish root and was serving
these local-only files publicly; `docs/.assetsignore` is now a backstop).

- **Architecture (no secrets):** Azure App Service (Web App for Containers) inside the UIUC
  `urbana-business-disruptionlab` subscription, fronted by App Service Easy Auth in API/bearer
  mode (Entra platform auth, RFC 9728 PRM + `401` challenge). The app reads the trusted
  `X-MS-CLIENT-PRINCIPAL-ID`; each caller passes their own `X-Canvas-Token`; the Canvas URL is
  server-pinned; `CANVAS_API_TOKEN` must never be set in HTTP mode (startup guard). Deploy is
  branch→slot GitHub Actions (`deploy-prod.yml` / `deploy-staging.yml`).
- The open-source **self-hosted (stdio)** path is the public product — see `README.md` / `AGENTS.md`.
  HTTP-transport env-var *names* live in `env.template` / `core/config.py`; the hosted *instance*
  is operator-only.

## Session Log
> Full history: [internal/session-history.md](./internal/session-history.md)

### 2026-07-20/21 — FERPA anonymization bypass fixed (#164/PR #165), merged + deployed; fastmcp CVE flagged
- **Fixed the high-severity anonymization bypass** carried across weekly reports #162→#163:
  `_should_anonymize_endpoint()` checked its `/courses`-containing safe-list *before* the student-data
  list, silently skipping central anonymization for nearly all course-scoped traffic (enrollments,
  submissions, analytics, discussion `/view`+`/entry_list`). Filed standalone **#164**, fixed on
  `fix/anonymization-bypass` TDD-style (13 failing tests reproduced the leak surface first). Fix spans
  both layers: sensitive-first segment-aware endpoint gate (page-slug false-positive guard, querystring
  strip) **and** anonymizer recursion gaps (discussion `/view` wrapper incl. `new_entries`/`participants`,
  enrollment nested `user`, `looks_like_user` guard so non-user dicts never get fabricated identity fields).
- **PR #165 merged** (squash `f2e45ac`, admin bypass) after a 4-agent review round-trip — Codex (P1:
  `new_entries` leak), Copilot (page-slug substring false-positive), claude bot (fabricated enrollment
  identity fields) each caught a real, *different* miss; all fixed + tested. 40 tests in new
  `tests/security/test_anonymization_endpoints.py`; suite 610 green. Auto-deployed to hosted prod (verified).
- **Follow-up #166 filed**: anonymizer's duck-typed `data_type` routing mis-shapes non-user records +
  the `ENABLE_DATA_ANONYMIZATION=false` flag being ignored at tool layer.
- **fastmcp 2.14.7 now carries PYSEC-2026-2475/2476** (fixed only in 3.2.0+) — this is why the
  Dependency Vulnerability Scan fails on `main` since 7/19. Commented on #145: re-scope PR #152's
  remaining Azure/Entra validation to fastmcp 3.x, coordinate with Ash's #142.
- Committed the 7/20 impact-stats refresh + deployed `docs/` to Cloudflare Pages (live-verified).
- Next: (1) **fastmcp 3.x migration** (#145/#152) — now CVE-urgent, dep-scan red on every PR until done;
  coordinate with **#142** (Ash, deadline ~7/27, check in this week). (2) **#106** mypy cleanup (idle 68
  days — post a status comment). (3) Triage remaining #163 medium items (docs coverage gaps #6, ruff in CI
  #7, stale test counts #9) and close #162/#163 digests. (4) #166 backlog. (5) Adam/Tech Services follow-up
  on the 7/8 review doc.
