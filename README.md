# Canvas MCP Server

<!--mcp-name: io.github.vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp-->

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This repository contains a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for interacting with the Canvas Learning Management System API. The server is designed to work with Claude Desktop and other MCP-compatible clients.

> **Note**: Recently refactored to a modular architecture for better maintainability. The legacy monolithic implementation has been archived.

## Overview

The Canvas MCP Server bridges the gap between Claude Desktop and Canvas Learning Management System, providing **both students and educators** with an intelligent interface to their Canvas environment. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), it enables natural language interactions with Canvas data.

### For Students 👨‍🎓

- Tracking upcoming assignments and deadlines
- Monitoring your grades across all courses
- Managing peer review assignments
- Accessing course content and discussions
- Organizing your TODO list

### For Educators 👨‍🏫
Enhance your teaching with:
- Assignment and grading management
- Student analytics and performance tracking
- Discussion and peer review facilitation
- **FERPA-compliant** student data handling
- Bulk messaging and communication tools

**[→ Get Started as an Educator](https://github.com/vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp/blob/main/docs/EDUCATOR_GUIDE.md)**

## 🔒 Privacy & Data Protection

### For Educators: FERPA Compliance

Complete FERPA compliance through systematic data anonymization when working with student data:

- **Source-level data anonymization** converts real names to consistent anonymous IDs (Student_xxxxxxxx)
- **Automatic email masking** and PII filtering from discussion posts and submissions
- **Local-only processing** with configurable privacy controls (`ENABLE_DATA_ANONYMIZATION=true`)
- **FERPA-compliant analytics**: Ask "Which students need support?" without exposing real identities
- **De-anonymization mapping tool** for faculty to correlate anonymous IDs with real students locally

All student data is anonymized **before** it reaches AI systems. See [Educator Guide](https://github.com/vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp/blob/main/docs/EDUCATOR_GUIDE.md) for configuration details.

### For Students: Your Data Stays Private

- **Your data only**: Student tools access only your own Canvas data via Canvas API's "self" endpoints
- **Local processing**: Everything runs on your machine - no data sent to external servers
- **No tracking**: Your Canvas usage and AI interactions remain private
- **No anonymization needed**: Since you're only accessing your own data, there are no privacy concerns

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** - Required for modern features and type hints
- **Canvas API Access** - API token and institution URL
- **MCP Client** - Claude Desktop (recommended) or other MCP-compatible client

> **Note**: While Canvas MCP is designed to work with any MCP client, setup instructions in this guide focus on Claude Desktop. Configuration for other clients may vary.

## Installation

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install uv package manager (faster than pip)
pip install uv

# Install the package
uv pip install -e .
```

### 2. Configure Environment

```bash
# Copy environment template
cp env.template .env

# Edit with your Canvas credentials
# Required: CANVAS_API_TOKEN, CANVAS_API_URL
```

Get your Canvas API token from: **Canvas → Account → Settings → New Access Token**

> **Note for Students**: Some educational institutions restrict API token creation for students. If you see an error like "There is a limit to the number of access tokens you can create" or cannot find the token creation option, contact your institution's Canvas administrator or IT support department to request API access or assistance in creating a token.

### 3. Claude Desktop Setup

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "canvas-api": {
      "command": "canvas-mcp-server"
    }
  }
}
```

## Verification

Test your setup:

```bash
# Test Canvas API connection
canvas-mcp-server --test

# View configuration
canvas-mcp-server --config

# Start server (for manual testing)
canvas-mcp-server
```

## Technical Details

### Modern Architecture (2025)

Built with current Python ecosystem best practices:

- **Package Structure**: Modern `src/` layout with `pyproject.toml`
- **Dependency Management**: Fast `uv` package manager with locked dependencies
- **Configuration**: Environment-based config with validation and templates
- **Entry Points**: Proper CLI commands via `pyproject.toml` scripts
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints and runtime validation

### Core Components

- **Smart Caching**: Intelligent request caching with configurable TTL
- **Configuration System**: Environment-based config with validation and defaults
- **Educational Focus**: Tools designed for real teaching workflows

### Dependencies

Modern Python packages (see `pyproject.toml`):
- **`fastmcp`**: MCP server framework
- **`httpx`**: Async HTTP client
- **`python-dotenv`**: Environment configuration
- **`pydantic`**: Data validation and settings

For contributors, see the [Development Guide](https://github.com/vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp/blob/main/docs/CLAUDE.md) for detailed architecture and development reference.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Server Won't Start** - Verify your [Configuration](#configuration) setup: `.env` file, virtual environment path, and dependencies
2. **Authentication Errors** - Check your Canvas API token validity and permissions
3. **Connection Issues** - Verify Canvas API URL correctness and network access
4. **Debugging** - Check Claude Desktop console logs or run server manually for error output

## Security & Privacy Features

### API Security
- Your Canvas API token grants access to your Canvas account
- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- The server runs locally on your machine - no external data transmission
- Consider using a token with limited permissions if possible

### Privacy Controls (Educators Only)

Educators working with student data can enable FERPA-compliant anonymization:

```bash
# In your .env file
ENABLE_DATA_ANONYMIZATION=true  # Anonymizes student names/emails before AI processing
ANONYMIZATION_DEBUG=true        # Debug anonymization (optional)
```

Students don't need anonymization since they only access their own data.

For detailed privacy configuration, see:
- **[Educator Guide](https://github.com/vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp/blob/main/docs/EDUCATOR_GUIDE.md)** - FERPA compliance and anonymization
- **[Student Guide](https://github.com/vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp/blob/main/docs/STUDENT_GUIDE.md)** - Privacy information for students

## Publishing to MCP Registry

This server is published to the [Model Context Protocol Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/) for easy installation.

### Automated Publishing (Recommended)

Publishing is automated via GitHub Actions:

1. **Prepare a release**:
   ```bash
   # Update version in pyproject.toml
   # Update CHANGELOG if applicable
   git commit -am "chore: bump version to X.Y.Z"
   git push
   ```

2. **Create and push a version tag**:
   ```bash
   git tag vX.Y.Z
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

3. **Automated workflow**:
   - Runs tests
   - Builds Python package
   - Publishes to PyPI
   - Publishes to MCP Registry using GitHub OIDC

### Prerequisites for Publishing

- **PyPI Account**: Create account at [pypi.org](https://pypi.org)
- **Trusted Publisher Setup** (recommended, no tokens needed):
  1. Visit [PyPI Trusted Publishers](https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/)
  2. Add a "pending publisher" for your repository:
     - **Owner**: `vishalsachdev`
     - **Repository**: `canvas-mcp`
     - **Workflow**: `publish-mcp.yml`
     - **Environment**: (leave blank)
  3. This reserves the package name and enables tokenless publishing

**Alternative**: Use API token (legacy method - not recommended):
- Generate token at PyPI → Account Settings → API tokens
- Add as `PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret in repository settings
- Update workflow to use `password: ${{ secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN }}`

### Manual Publishing (Alternative)

For manual publishing:

```bash
# Install MCP Publisher
curl -fsSL https://modelcontextprotocol.io/install.sh | sh

# Login using GitHub
mcp-publisher login github

# Publish server
mcp-publisher publish
```

### Registry Validation

The `server.json` configuration is automatically validated against the MCP schema during CI/CD. To validate locally:

```bash
# Download schema
curl -s https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0/server.schema.json -o /tmp/mcp-schema.json

# Validate (requires jsonschema CLI)
pip install jsonschema
jsonschema -i server.json /tmp/mcp-schema.json
```
