# Canvas MCP Server

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This repository contains a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for interacting with the Canvas Learning Management System API. The server is designed to work with Claude Desktop and other MCP-compatible clients.

> **Note**: Recently refactored to a modular architecture for better maintainability. The legacy monolithic implementation has been archived.

## Overview

The Canvas MCP Server bridges the gap between Claude Desktop and Canvas Learning Management System, providing **both students and educators** with an intelligent interface to their Canvas environment. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), it enables natural language interactions with Canvas data.

- Bulk messaging and communication tools

**[→ Get Started as an Educator](./docs/EDUCATOR_GUIDE.md)**

## 🔒 Privacy & Data Protection

### For Educators: FERPA Compliance

Complete FERPA compliance through systematic data anonymization when working with student data:

- **Source-level data anonymization** converts real names to consistent anonymous IDs (Student_xxxxxxxx)
- **Automatic email masking** and PII filtering from discussion posts and submissions
- **Local-only processing** with configurable privacy controls (`ENABLE_DATA_ANONYMIZATION=true`)
- **FERPA-compliant analytics**: Ask "Which students need support?" without exposing real identities
- **De-anonymization mapping tool** for faculty to correlate anonymous IDs with real students locally

All student data is anonymized **before** it reaches AI systems. See [Educator Guide](./docs/EDUCATOR_GUIDE.md) for configuration details.

### For Students: Your Data Stays Private

- **Your data only**: Student tools access only your own Canvas data via Canvas API's "self" endpoints
- **Local processing**: Everything runs on your machine - no data sent to external servers
- **No tracking**: Your Canvas usage and AI interactions remain private
- **No anonymization needed**: Since you're only accessing your own data, there are no privacy concerns

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** - Required for modern features and type hints
- **Canvas API Access** - API token and institution URL
- **MCP Client** - Claude Desktop (recommended) or other MCP-compatible client

## Quick Start (Automated Installation)

The fastest way to get started is with our automated installer:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vishalsachdev/canvas-mcp.git
cd canvas-mcp

# Run the automated installer
python scripts/install.py
```

The installer will:
- ✅ Set up Python environment with `uv` package manager
- ✅ Install all dependencies automatically  
- ✅ Create environment configuration template
- ✅ Configure Claude Desktop integration
- ✅ Test the installation

## Manual Installation

If you prefer manual setup:

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install uv package manager (faster than pip)
pip install uv

# Install the package
uv pip install -e .
```

### 2. Configure Environment

```bash
# Copy environment template
cp env.template .env

# Edit with your Canvas credentials
# Required: CANVAS_API_TOKEN, CANVAS_API_URL
```

Get your Canvas API token from: **Canvas → Account → Settings → New Access Token**

### 3. Claude Desktop Setup

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "canvas-api": {
      "command": "canvas-mcp-server"
    }
  }
}
```

## Verification

Test your setup:

```bash
# Test Canvas API connection
canvas-mcp-server --test

# View configuration
canvas-mcp-server --config

# Start server (for manual testing)
canvas-mcp-server
```

## Technical Details

### Modern Architecture (2025)

Built with current Python ecosystem best practices:

- **Package Structure**: Modern `src/` layout with `pyproject.toml`
- **Dependency Management**: Fast `uv` package manager with locked dependencies
- **Configuration**: Environment-based config with validation and templates
- **Entry Points**: Proper CLI commands via `pyproject.toml` scripts
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints and runtime validation

### Core Components

- **Async Architecture**: `httpx` client with connection pooling and rate limiting
- **Smart Caching**: Intelligent request caching with configurable TTL
- **Configuration System**: Environment-based config with validation and defaults
- **Educational Focus**: Tools designed for real teaching workflows

### Dependencies

Modern Python packages (see `pyproject.toml`):
- **`fastmcp`**: MCP server framework
- **`httpx`**: Async HTTP client
- **`python-dotenv`**: Environment configuration
- **`pydantic`**: Data validation and settings

- **Code Quality**: `ruff` and `black` for formatting and linting

For contributors, see the [Development Guide](./docs/CLAUDE.md) for detailed architecture and development reference.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Server Won't Start** - Verify your [Configuration](#configuration) setup: `.env` file, virtual environment path, and dependencies
2. **Authentication Errors** - Check your Canvas API token validity and permissions
3. **Connection Issues** - Verify Canvas API URL correctness and network access
4. **Debugging** - Check Claude Desktop console logs or run server manually for error output

## Security & Privacy Features

### API Security
- Your Canvas API token grants access to your Canvas account
- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- The server runs locally on your machine - no external data transmission
- Consider using a token with limited permissions if possible

### Privacy Controls (Educators Only)

Educators working with student data can enable FERPA-compliant anonymization:

```bash
# In your .env file
ENABLE_DATA_ANONYMIZATION=true  # Anonymizes student names/emails before AI processing
ANONYMIZATION_DEBUG=true        # Debug anonymization (optional)
```

Students don't need anonymization since they only access their own data.

For detailed privacy configuration, see:
- **[Educator Guide](./docs/EDUCATOR_GUIDE.md)** - FERPA compliance and anonymization
- **[Student Guide](./docs/STUDENT_GUIDE.md)** - Privacy information for students

## Publishing to MCP Registry

This server is published to the [Model Context Protocol Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/) for easy installation.

### Automated Publishing (Recommended)

Publishing is automated via GitHub Actions:

1. **Prepare a release**:
   ```bash
   # Update version in pyproject.toml
   # Update CHANGELOG if applicable
   git commit -am "chore: bump version to X.Y.Z"
   git push
   ```

2. **Create and push a version tag**:
   ```bash
   git tag vX.Y.Z
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

3. **Automated workflow**:
   - Runs tests
   - Builds Python package
   - Publishes to PyPI
   - Publishes to MCP Registry using GitHub OIDC

### Prerequisites for Publishing

- **PyPI Account**: Create account at [pypi.org](https://pypi.org)
- **Trusted Publisher Setup** (recommended, no tokens needed):
  1. Visit [PyPI Trusted Publishers](https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/)
  2. Add a "pending publisher" for your repository:
     - **Owner**: `vishalsachdev`
     - **Repository**: `canvas-mcp`
     - **Workflow**: `publish-mcp.yml`
     - **Environment**: (leave blank)
  3. This reserves the package name and enables tokenless publishing

**Alternative**: Use API token (legacy method - not recommended):
- Generate token at PyPI → Account Settings → API tokens
- Add as `PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret in repository settings
- Update workflow to use `password: ${{ secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN }}`

### Manual Publishing (Alternative)

For manual publishing:

```bash
# Install MCP Publisher
curl -fsSL https://modelcontextprotocol.io/install.sh | sh

# Login using GitHub
mcp-publisher login github

# Publish server
mcp-publisher publish
```

### Registry Validation

The `server.json` configuration is automatically validated against the MCP schema during CI/CD. To validate locally:

```bash
# Download schema
curl -s https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0/server.schema.json -o /tmp/mcp-schema.json

# Validate (requires jsonschema CLI)
pip install jsonschema
jsonschema -i server.json /tmp/mcp-schema.json
```
