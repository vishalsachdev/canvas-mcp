# Canvas MCP Skills: Quick Start Guide

## What are Skills?

**Skills** extend Claude's capabilities by providing workflow intelligence on top of Canvas MCP tools. Think of them as "expert playbooks" that teach Claude how to handle complex educational workflows.

### 30-Second Explanation

- **Canvas MCP**: Provides low-level Canvas API tools (get assignments, post grades, etc.)
- **Skills**: Provides high-level workflows that use those tools intelligently
- **Result**: You ask Claude to "plan my week" and get a complete strategic plan, not just raw data

## Quick Start: Install Your First Skill

### Step 1: Install a Skill (2 minutes)

```bash
# Navigate to Claude's skills directory
cd ~/.claude/skills/

# Copy the weekly planner skill
cp -r /path/to/canvas-mcp/examples/skills/weekly-planner ./

# That's it! The skill is installed.
```

### Step 2: Use the Skill (Immediate)

Just talk to Claude naturally:

```
You: "Help me plan my week"

Claude: [Automatically uses weekly-planner skill]
- Fetches your Canvas assignments
- Analyzes your grades
- Checks peer reviews
- Creates prioritized daily plan
- Provides time management tips
```

**No special commands needed.** Claude recognizes when to use the skill and activates it automatically.

## How Skills Work

```
Your message
    ‚Üì

## Installing More Skills

### From Examples Directory

```bash
# List available example skills
ls canvas-mcp/examples/skills/

# Install a skill
cp -r canvas-mcp/examples/skills/[skill-name] ~/.claude/skills/
```

### Verify Installation

```bash

ls ~/.claude/skills/

# You should see your skill directories
```

Claude automatically detects skills in this directory. No restart needed!

## Creating Your Own Skill

### Minimum Viable Skill

1. **Create directory**: `~/.claude/skills/my-skill/`

2. **Create SKILL.md**:
```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does
---

# My Skill

## Purpose
What this skill accomplishes

## When to Activate
When users ask about [X]

## Process
1. Use Canvas MCP tool [tool-name]
2. Analyze the data
3. Provide [specific output]
```

3. **Test it**: Say something that matches "When to Activate"

## Best Practices

### For Students

‚úÖ **Do**:
- Use skills for weekly planning: "Plan my week"
- Ask for assignment help: "Help me with this assignment"
- Check status: "What do I need to do?"

‚ùå **Don't**:
- Try to manually invoke skills (they're automatic)
- Use overly generic prompts like "help" (be specific)

### For Educators

‚úÖ **Do**:
- Enable anonymization: `ENABLE_DATA_ANONYMIZATION=true`
- Use batch grading: "Grade all submissions for Assignment 3"
- Review suggestions before finalizing

‚ùå **Don't**:
- Disable anonymization when working with student data
- Blindly accept all suggestions (you're still in charge)

## Troubleshooting

### "Skill doesn't seem to activate"

**Check**:
1. Is skill in `~/.claude/skills/`?
2. Does SKILL.md have proper YAML frontmatter?
3. Does your prompt match "When to Activate"?

**Fix**: Try more explicit prompts that clearly match skill's purpose

### "Getting raw data instead of analysis"

**Likely**: Skill isn't activating, Claude is using tools directly

**Fix**:
1. Verify skill installation
2. Use prompts that match skill's description
3. Example: "Plan my week" instead of "Show assignments"

### "Skill uses wrong tools"

**Check**: Does your skill's "Required MCP Tools" section list correct tool names?

**Fix**: Match tool names exactly to Canvas MCP tools (see `tools/README.md`)
