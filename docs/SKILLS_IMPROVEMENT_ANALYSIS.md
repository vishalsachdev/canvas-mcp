# Canvas MCP: Skills Integration Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes how the Canvas MCP server can be significantly enhanced by leveraging Claude's new **Skills** feature, announced October 2025. Skills would complement the existing MCP server by providing higher-level workflows, templates, and automation on top of the low-level Canvas API tools.

## Understanding the Architecture

### Current State: MCP Server
Canvas MCP currently provides:
- **Low-level API tools**: Direct Canvas API access (get assignments, post grades, etc.)
- **Granular operations**: Individual API calls for specific tasks
- **Tool-based interface**: Claude uses these tools when explicitly needed

### Complementary: Claude Skills
Skills would add:
- **High-level workflows**: Multi-step processes combining multiple MCP tools
- **Autonomous invocation**: Claude automatically activates skills based on context
- **Domain expertise**: Built-in knowledge about educational workflows
- **Templates & patterns**: Reusable content and process templates

## Key Insight: Skills + MCP = Powerful Combination

**MCP Server (Canvas MCP)** = The "hands" - Direct API access to Canvas
**Skills** = The "brain" - Workflows, patterns, and expertise using those hands

This is analogous to:
- MCP = Database drivers
- Skills = ORM and business logic
